                    Hello, everyone! I'm Jaddu Srinu, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree
                    in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS) at IIITDM Kurnool. I am passionate about exploring
                    the vast possibilities within the realm of AI and data science, and I'm <br>excited to be part of the
                    dynamic field of technology. In my academic journey at IIITDM Kurnool, I've had the opportunity to delve
                    into The various AI  and data science projects and coursework, which have not only expanded my knowledge
                     but also fueled my curiosity to explore innovative solutions to real-world problems.

                Predicting house prices without using machine learning inbuilt libraries involves creating a model from scratch,
                implementing algorithms manually, and handling data processing without relying on established machine learning frameworks.
                Below is a  Directed link  for the Project to Build  a simple house price prediction model without using ML inbuilt libraries
